TODO

    - 'codeIsNoErrors' - need to change this name, as it is obfuscating.

    - Storage unbound may be more complex to avoid output of some informational noise. Try to unmount storage when it is already unmounted.

    - Make it less talkative.

    - '--info' action may show processes using the storage.

BUGS

    - Not tested.
